# 2FA Frontend

This repository contains the frontend of a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) application. The application provides users with an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication alongside their username and password.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for 2FA setup and login.
- Supports time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) for additional security.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and layout.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests to the backend.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between different views.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine. You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Access to the backend service for 2FA functionalities.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barmor12/2FAFrontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 2FAFrontend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Register a new user and set up 2FA using a TOTP app (like Google Authenticator).
- Log in with your username, password, and the TOTP code generated by the authentication app.
- Manage 2FA settings in the user profile.

- **src/**: The main folder for the source code.
  - **components/**: Reusable React components.
  - **pages/**: Different pages/views of the app (e.g., Login, 2FA Setup).
  - **services/**: Axios configuration and API calls.
  - **App.js**: Main application component.
